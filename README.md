# Stagewise Newton Method for Dynamic Game Control with Imperfect State Observation

This repository contains the python implementation for the iterative dynamic game solver.

The implementation is based on [Crocoddyl (1.9.0)](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl). All the code necessary to reproduce the experiments of the paper is in the folder `python/plots`.
