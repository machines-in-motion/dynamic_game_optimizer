# Stagewise Newton Method for Dynamic Game Control with Imperfect State Observation

This repository contains the python implementation for the iterative dynamic game solver published in the [IEEE Control Systems Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9800769) and freely available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11341).

The implementation is based on [Crocoddyl (1.9.0)](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl). All the code necessary to reproduce the experiments of the paper is in the folder `python/plots`.
